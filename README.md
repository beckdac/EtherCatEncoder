# EtherCatEncoder
Open-source EtherCat Spindle Encoder using GDS32F407 and LAN9252

This code was developed for this board from AliExpress:
![GD32+LAN9252 Development Board](doc/gd32_lan9252.jpg?raw=true "GD32+LAN9252 Development Board")

### Attribution:
This code was based on many sources, but instrumental was [MetalMusings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOtMrlHCCic). They had a working encoder and this uses that same PDO format and much of the encoder counting structure was derived from that video.
